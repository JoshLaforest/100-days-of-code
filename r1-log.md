## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on Survey Form as part of FreeCodeCamp Curriculum. I feel that I am starting to get the hang of HTML and CSS. Coding is so much fun!

Plan is to continue working on the CSS tomorrow.

### R1D2
Worked on Product Landing Page as part of FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Overall, I'm able to combine basic HTML and CSS fairly well.

Worked on another project for FreeCodeCamp curriculum. I'm honestly having so much fun. I didn't manage to post yesterday, caught horrid cold over weekend. 
Yay, illness!
